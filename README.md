Estimation of Stress Intensity Factor(SIF) using Finite Element Analysis.
Stress intensity factor(SIF) for Double Edge Cracked Plate for Numerical SIF values using Ansys Mechanical APDL has been evaluated.
Three different types of meshes have been considered; fine, moderate, coarse meshes.
In each type of Mesh, Normal(default) mesh and Quarter Point Element(QPE) Mesh is considered near the crack tip.
And in the finest mesh for each Normal and QPE mesh near crack tip, plane stress and plane strain conditions have been assumed.
Resulting into in all Eight cases.
